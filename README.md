# Koe (声)

A zero-GUI macOS voice input tool. Press a hotkey, speak, and the corrected text is pasted into whatever app you're using.

For more information, visit the documentation at **[koe.li](https://koe.li)**.

## The Name

**Koe** (声, pronounced "ko-eh") is the Japanese word for *voice*. Written as こえ in hiragana, it's one of the most fundamental words in the language — simple, clear, and direct. That's exactly the philosophy behind this tool: your voice goes in, clean text comes out, with nothing in between. No flashy UI, no unnecessary steps. Just 声 — voice, in its purest form.

## Why Koe?

I tried nearly every voice input app on the market. They were either paid, ugly, or inconvenient — bloated UIs, clunky dictionary management, and too many clicks to do simple things.

Koe takes a different approach:

- **No GUI at all.** The only visual element is a tiny icon in the menu bar.
- **All configuration lives in plain text files** under `~/.koe/`. Edit them with any text editor, vim, or even a script.
- **Dictionary is a plain `.txt` file.** No need to open an app and add words one by one through a GUI. Just edit `~/.koe/dictionary.txt` — one term per line. You can even use Claude Code or other AI tools to bulk-generate domain-specific terms.
- **Changes take effect immediately.** Edit any config file and the new settings are used automatically. ASR, LLM, dictionary, and prompt changes apply on the next hotkey press. Hotkey changes are detected within a few seconds. No restart, no reload button.
- **Tiny footprint.** Even after installation, Koe stays **under 15 MB**, and its memory usage is typically **around 20 MB**. It launches fast, wastes almost no disk space, and stays out of your way.
- **Built with native macOS technologies.** Objective-C handles hotkeys, audio capture, clipboard access, permissions, and paste automation directly through Apple's own APIs.
- **Rust does the heavy lifting.** The performance-critical core runs in Rust, which gives Koe low overhead, fast execution, and strong memory safety guarantees.
- **No Chromium tax.** Many comparable Electron-based apps ship at **200+ MB** and carry the overhead of an embedded Chromium runtime. Koe avoids that entire stack, which helps keep memory usage low and the app feeling lightweight.

## How It Works

1. Press and hold the trigger key (default: **Fn**, configurable) — Koe starts listening
2. Audio streams in real-time to a local ASR engine for speech recognition
3. The ASR transcript is corrected by an LLM (any OpenAI-compatible API) — fixing capitalization, punctuation, spacing, and terminology
4. The corrected text is automatically pasted into the active input field

### ASR Providers

Koe supports two ASR backends, selectable via `~/.koe/config.yaml`:

| Provider | Mode | Requires | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **sherpa-onnx** (default) | Local, offline | Model files (~230 MB) | Portable, no dependencies |
| **FunASR** | Local server, 2pass | Docker | Higher accuracy (streaming + offline correction) |

Both run entirely locally — no cloud API keys needed for ASR.

- **LLM**: supports **OpenAI-compatible APIs only** (optional, for text correction)

## Installation

Koe currently supports **Apple Silicon Macs only**. The prebuilt binaries and
current build configuration target `aarch64-apple-darwin`, so `x86_64` Intel
Macs are not supported.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap owo-network/brew
brew install owo-network/brew/koe
```

### Release

You can also download the latest release directly from GitHub:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/missuo/koe/releases/latest)

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

- macOS 13.0+
- Apple Silicon Mac (`aarch64-apple-darwin`)
- Rust toolchain (`rustup`)
- Xcode with command line tools
- [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`)

#### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/missuo/koe.git
cd koe

# Generate Xcode project
cd KoeApp && xcodegen && cd ..

# Build everything
make build
```

#### Run

```bash
make run
```

Or open the built app directly:

```bash
open ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Koe-*/Build/Products/Release/Koe.app
```

### Permissions

Koe requires **three macOS permissions** to function. You'll be prompted to grant them on first launch. All three are mandatory — without any one of them, Koe cannot complete its core workflow.

| Permission | Why it's needed | What happens without it |
|---|---|---|
| **Microphone** | Captures audio from your mic and streams it to the ASR service for speech recognition. | Koe cannot hear you at all. Recording will not start. |
| **Accessibility** | Simulates a `Cmd+V` keystroke to paste the corrected text into the active input field of any app. | Koe will still copy the text to your clipboard, but cannot auto-paste. You'll need to paste manually. |
| **Input Monitoring** | Listens for the trigger key (default: **Fn**, configurable) globally so Koe can detect when you press/release it, regardless of which app is in the foreground. | Koe cannot detect the hotkey. You won't be able to trigger recording. |

To grant permissions: **System Settings → Privacy & Security** → enable Koe under each of the three categories above.

## Configuration

All config files live in `~/.koe/` and are auto-generated on first launch:

```
~/.koe/
├── config.yaml          # Main configuration
├── dictionary.txt       # User dictionary (hotwords + LLM correction)
├── history.db           # Usage statistics (SQLite, auto-created)
├── system_prompt.txt    # LLM system prompt (customizable)
└── user_prompt.txt      # LLM user prompt template (customizable)
```

### config.yaml

Below is the full configuration with explanations for every field.

#### ASR (Speech Recognition)

Koe supports two local ASR providers. Set `provider` to choose:

```yaml
asr:
  # "sherpa" (local, offline) or "funasr" (local server, 2pass)
  provider: "sherpa"
  final_wait_timeout_ms: 5000
```

**sherpa-onnx** (default) — runs entirely offline, no server needed:

```bash
# Download the bilingual model (~230 MB, one-time):
mkdir -p ~/.koe/models
curl -SL https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/download/asr-models/sherpa-onnx-streaming-paraformer-bilingual-zh-en.tar.bz2 | tar xj -C ~/.koe/models/
```

```yaml
asr:
  provider: "sherpa"
  model_dir: "models/sherpa-onnx-streaming-paraformer-bilingual-zh-en"  # relative to ~/.koe/
  hotwords_score: 1.5   # boosting score for dictionary hotwords (transducer models only)
  num_threads: 2        # inference threads
```

**FunASR** — higher accuracy with 2pass mode (streaming + offline correction), requires Docker:

```bash
# Start the FunASR server (or use `make funasr`):
docker run -p 10096:10095 -it --privileged=true \
  -v ~/funasr-models:/workspace/models \
  registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/funasr_repo/funasr:funasr-runtime-sdk-online-cpu-0.1.13 \
  bash -c "cd /workspace/FunASR/runtime && bash run_server_2pass.sh --download-model-dir /workspace/models --certfile 0"
```

```yaml
asr:
  provider: "funasr"
  url: "ws://localhost:10096"
  mode: "2pass"              # "2pass" (recommended), "online", or "offline"
  chunk_size: [5, 10, 5]     # [lookback, chunk, lookahead] in 60ms units
  enable_itn: true           # inverse text normalization
```

Switch between providers by changing `provider` in `~/.koe/config.yaml` — takes effect on the next hotkey press, no restart needed.

#### LLM (Text Correction)

After ASR, the transcript is sent to an LLM for correction (capitalization,
spacing, terminology, filler word removal). Koe currently supports
**OpenAI-compatible APIs only** for this step. Native provider-specific APIs that
are not OpenAI-compatible are not supported directly.

```yaml
llm:
  # OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.
  # Examples:
  #   OpenAI:    "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  #   Anthropic: "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"  (needs compatible proxy)
  #   Local:     "http://localhost:8080/v1"
  base_url: ""

  # API key. Supports environment variable substitution with ${VAR_NAME} syntax.
  # Examples:
  #   Direct:  "sk-xxxxxxxx"
  #   Env var: "${LLM_API_KEY}"
  api_key: ""

  # Model name. Use a fast, cheap model — latency matters here.
  # Recommended: "gpt-4o-mini" or any similar fast model.
  model: ""

  # LLM sampling parameters. temperature: 0 = deterministic, best for correction tasks.
  temperature: 0
  top_p: 1

  # LLM request timeout in milliseconds.
  timeout_ms: 8000

  # Max tokens in LLM response. 1024 is plenty for voice input correction.
  max_output_tokens: 1024

  # How many dictionary entries to include in the LLM prompt.
  # 0 = send all entries (recommended for dictionaries under ~500 entries).
  # Set a limit if your dictionary is very large and you want to reduce prompt size.
  dictionary_max_candidates: 0

  # Paths to prompt files, relative to ~/.koe/.
  # Edit these files to customize how the LLM corrects text.
  system_prompt_path: "system_prompt.txt"
  user_prompt_path: "user_prompt.txt"
```

#### Feedback (Sound Effects)

```yaml
feedback:
  start_sound: true    # Play sound when recording starts
  stop_sound: true     # Play sound when recording stops
  error_sound: true    # Play sound on errors
```

#### Hotkey

```yaml
hotkey:
  # Trigger key for voice input.
  # Options: fn | left_option | right_option | left_command | right_command
  trigger_key: "fn"
```

| Option | Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fn` | Fn/Globe key | Default. Works on all Mac keyboards |
| `left_option` | Left Option | Good alternative if Fn is remapped |
| `right_option` | Right Option | Least likely to conflict with shortcuts |
| `left_command` | Left Command | May conflict with system shortcuts |
| `right_command` | Right Command | Less conflict-prone than left Command |

Hotkey changes take effect automatically within a few seconds — no restart needed.

#### Dictionary

```yaml
dictionary:
  path: "dictionary.txt"  # Relative to ~/.koe/
```

### Dictionary

The dictionary serves two purposes:

1. **ASR hotwords** — sent to the speech recognition engine to improve accuracy for specific terms
2. **LLM correction** — included in the prompt so the LLM prefers these spellings and terms

Edit `~/.koe/dictionary.txt`:

```
# One term per line. Lines starting with # are comments.
Cloudflare
PostgreSQL
Kubernetes
GitHub Actions
VS Code
```

#### Bulk-Generating Dictionary Terms

Instead of typing terms one by one, you can use AI tools to generate domain-specific vocabulary. For example, with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code):

```
You: Add common DevOps and cloud infrastructure terms to my dictionary file at ~/.koe/dictionary.txt
```

Or with a simple shell command:

```bash
# Append terms from a project's codebase
grep -roh '[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*' src/ | sort -u >> ~/.koe/dictionary.txt

# Append terms from a package.json
jq -r '.dependencies | keys[]' package.json >> ~/.koe/dictionary.txt
```

Since the dictionary is just a text file, you can version-control it, share it across machines, or script its maintenance however you like.

### Prompts

The LLM correction behavior is fully customizable via two prompt files:

- **`~/.koe/system_prompt.txt`** — defines the correction rules (capitalization, spacing, punctuation, filler word removal, etc.)
- **`~/.koe/user_prompt.txt`** — template that assembles the ASR output, interim history, and dictionary into the final LLM request

Available template placeholders in `user_prompt.txt`:

| Placeholder | Description |
|---|---|
| `{{asr_text}}` | The final ASR transcript text |
| `{{interim_history}}` | ASR interim revision history — shows how the transcript changed over time, helping the LLM identify uncertain words |
| `{{dictionary_entries}}` | Filtered dictionary entries for LLM context |

The default prompts are tuned for software developers working in mixed Chinese-English, but you can adapt them for any language or domain.

## Usage Statistics

Koe automatically tracks your voice input usage in a local SQLite database at `~/.koe/history.db`. You can view a summary directly in the menu bar dropdown — it shows total characters, words, recording time, session count, and input speed.

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- Unix timestamp
    duration_ms INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Recording duration in milliseconds
    text TEXT NOT NULL,            -- Final transcribed text
    char_count INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- CJK character count
    word_count INTEGER NOT NULL   -- English word count
);
```

### Querying Your Data

You can query the database directly with `sqlite3`:

```bash
# View all sessions
sqlite3 ~/.koe/history.db "SELECT * FROM sessions ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Total stats
sqlite3 ~/.koe/history.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as sessions, SUM(duration_ms)/1000 as total_seconds, SUM(char_count) as chars, SUM(word_count) as words FROM sessions;"

# Daily breakdown
sqlite3 ~/.koe/history.db "SELECT date(timestamp, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as day, COUNT(*) as sessions, SUM(char_count) as chars, SUM(word_count) as words FROM sessions GROUP BY day ORDER BY day DESC;"
```

You can also build your own dashboard or visualization on top of this database — it's just a standard SQLite file.

## AI-Assisted Setup

Koe provides a skill that works with any AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) to guide you through the entire setup process interactively.

### Install the Skill

```bash
npx skills add missuo/koe
```

The command will let you choose which AI coding tool to install the skill for.

### What It Does

Once installed, the `koe-setup` skill will:

1. Check your installation and permissions
2. Walk you through ASR and LLM credential setup
3. Ask about your profession and generate a **personalized dictionary** tailored to your domain
4. Customize the **system prompt** based on your use case
5. Help you configure the trigger key and sound feedback

This is especially useful for first-time users who want a guided, interactive setup experience.

## Architecture

Koe is built as a native macOS app with two layers:

- **Objective-C shell** — handles macOS integration: hotkey detection, audio capture, clipboard management, paste simulation, menu bar UI, and usage statistics (SQLite)
- **Rust core library** — handles ASR (sherpa-onnx local inference or FunASR WebSocket streaming), LLM API calls, config management, transcript aggregation, and session orchestration

The two layers communicate via C FFI (Foreign Function Interface). The Rust core is compiled as a static library (`libkoe_core.a`) and linked into the Xcode project.

```

### ASR Pipeline

1. Audio streams to the selected ASR provider (sherpa-onnx local inference or FunASR WebSocket)
2. Streaming results arrive in real-time (`Interim` events)
3. Completed utterance segments are confirmed (`Definite` events)
4. `TranscriptAggregator` merges all results and tracks interim revision history
5. Final transcript + interim history + dictionary are sent to the LLM for correction
